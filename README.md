# Music Sheet Generator - CS 4100 Project
## Project Members: Mehr Anand (Project Manager), Mihalis Koutouvos, William, Sartorio, and Nalini Singh

### Problem Statement:
Traditional musical chord progression involves following complex patterns that blend statistical regularities (such as transitions) with theoretical constraints (such as where one’s voice should increase/decrease). With two AI models for generating coherent chord progressions, we should be able to simplify and investigate where this problem can be ameliorated. 

### Motivation:
Our motivation toward this problem stems from our collective admiration for music and the desire to aid in supporting traditional music composition by having AI models capture the complexity behind musical constraints.
